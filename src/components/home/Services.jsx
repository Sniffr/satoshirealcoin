          SAR token has by itself real estate projects as a backup real asset.
          Unlike meme coins that have no actual projects, SAR targets to achieve
          a consensus real estate ownership mechanism to its community by
          investing in commercial real estate, open source code 2-layer network
          that would enable young developers to bring solutions to humanity
          through developing their projects with very low network charges which
          will be achieved through merge between PoH, PoS and PoW consensus
          mechanism that would also be scaled.
